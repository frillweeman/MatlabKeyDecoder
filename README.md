# MATLAB Key Decoder

MATLAB-based key decoder for KW1 keys

This is my submission for [EE 384](https://catalog.uah.edu/undergrad/course-descriptions/ee/#:~:text=Prerequisite%3A%20EE%C2%A0382.-,ee%20384,--%20DIG%20SIGNAL%20PROCESS) at the [University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/). It accepts an image of a KW1 (Kwikset) key with specific criteria and outputs an annotated image with the computed bitting code.

Note that the key image [kw1-house.jpg](kw1-house.jpg) is a scrap key and not associated with any active lock.

See [Report](Report.pdf) and [Presentation](Presentation.pdf) for a full description.
